## Step11
<p>Working from the design, and implement the data model components of the project using Entity Framework to map the classes to the database table entities and the tables to the classes.</p>
<p>Deliverable requirements:
  <ul>
    <li>Project folders for Models,Views, and Controllers.</a></li>
    <img src="https://github.com/yanxu2021/GobangGame/blob/master/ScreenShots/1Folders%20for%20MVC.JPG">
    <li><a href="https://github.com/yanxu2021/GobangGame/tree/master/GobangGame/Models">Within Models folder-C# class files which describe and map to database table entities</a></li>
    <li><a href='https://github.com/yanxu2021/GobangGame/blob/master/GobangGame/Models/IGameRepository.cs'>Develop the interface.</a></li>
    <li>The primary data model, which the data model implements.</li>
    <li>Create a "Fake" or "TestDouble"class which also implements the data interface.</li>
    <li>Auto-generate a databse diagram.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
## Step12
<p>The project database tables and model classes are connected. Using code, connect to the database and create a controller and simple view which displays data read from tables and enables data taken from a simple user interface and storing the new or modified data back to the databse.</p>
<p>Deliverable requirements:
  <ul>
    <li>Screenshot of SSMS showing data stored in tables</li>
    <img src=" https://github.com/yanxu2021/GobangGame/blob/master/ScreenShots/9.JPG">
    <img src=" https://github.com/yanxu2021/GobangGame/blob/master/ScreenShots/17%20View%20Tabels.JPG">
    <li>Screenshot of application view showing data retrieved from the database and displayed on the page.</li>
       <img src=" https://github.com/yanxu2021/GobangGame/blob/master/ScreenShots/12.JPG">
    <li>Screenshot of the application demonstrating how the data is collected from the application(a form?).</li>
       <img src=" https://github.com/yanxu2021/GobangGame/blob/master/ScreenShots/17%20View%20Tabels.JPG">
    <li>Screenshot of the view showing how the data has changed.</li>
       <img src=" https://github.com/yanxu2021/GobangGame/blob/master/ScreenShots/13.JPG"> 
    </ul>
  </p>

## Step13
<p>Accordingly,plan the remaining work and the upcoming sprint starting with creating the formal prioritized product backlog items(PBIs) in the project repository.</p>
<p>Deliverable requirements:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="">From the issues tab in GitHub, add new issues. A well-constructed issue contain: A user story/Acceptance criteria/Additional supporting information such as diagrams, descriptions, screen captures, error messages, etc.</a></li>
    <li><a href="">Create a project board from the repository and add prioritized issues from the backlog. ToDo/InProcess/Done.</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
